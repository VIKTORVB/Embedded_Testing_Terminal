# Embedded_Testing_Terminal
This code is Part of my final year dissertation Project.
The full report on the project can be found here [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xPRcQXBHLx1FUwHEHeOpQhTvlnDdTOLL/view?usp=sharing).
The report includes both hardware and software specifications and a user manual that can be found in the appendix. 

# Discription
The program contains files, for UART communication, SPI communication, Display controll, and a user interface with various functions.
The devices main function is reading ASCCI characters trough it's UART port and displaying them on a screen. The device can also error check the recived data, and save it to an external SD card. The user can fully controll where and how each character is printed on the display, by sending different commands trough the UART port. The user can also controll the baud rate of the transsmission either manually trough the menu or by enabling the automatic baud rate calibration function.
